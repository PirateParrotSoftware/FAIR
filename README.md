# FAIR AI LICENSE (FAIL)

**FAIR AI LICENSE (FAIL)** is a custom software license designed to be similar in spirit
to permissive licenses (such as MIT), while explicitly restricting the use of licensed
software for training machine learning or AI models without a paid license.

The goal of this license is to allow broad use, modification, and distribution of software,
while reserving AI training rights for separate negotiation.

---

## Key Principles

- Free use, modification, and distribution of the software
- Clear and explicit restriction on AI training
- AI training permitted only under a separate paid license
- Simple, readable, and enforceable terms
- No ideological or manifesto-style language in the legal text
